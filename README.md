As a Junior JavaScript developer, after my training I still felt anxious about how to stand out in the job market. I consulted Copilot AI for advice, and it gave me a simple but powerful guide on how to build confidence as a web developer and stand out.

After going through the guide, I decided to embark on this journey of starting afresh — focusing on the 20% of concepts that power 80% of web apps.

My Commitment:
✔ I will practice daily, even in small chunks.

✔ I will document my progress so I can see growth over time.

✔ I will teach what I learn, because explaining makes knowledge stick.

✔ I will reflect honestly on my journey, turning anxiety into confidence.

Vision:
By following this routine, I aim to transform my skills from basic training into practical expertise. My goal is not just to write code, but to think like a developer, solve problems with confidence, and stand out in the job market.

This README is my personal roadmap. Each day I’ll add one reflection line, building a trail of progress that shows how far I’ve come.
